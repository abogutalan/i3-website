//         overview: `When one considers the miracle of the Qur’an, a topic which is often highlighted is that of
//         its preservation and there is very good reason for this. There are three significant reasons
//         as to why the Qur’an should not have been preserved:`,
//         translation: `And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be
//         mindful?`,

//         ref1: '[1]',
//         exp1: `While this initially may not present
//         itself as a problem, the fact that the Qur’an managed to transcend the literary fluency of
//         all the dialects of the many tribes while retaining the unity of its message, eloquence and
//         theological consistency is a testament to its metaphysical origins. The Qur’an in essence,
//         managed to standardize and unify the language of the Arabs and the Arabs themselves through
//         the mechanisms of the Ahruf and the Qira’at.`
