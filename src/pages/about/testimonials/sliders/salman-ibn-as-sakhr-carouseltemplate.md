  "After joining i3, I realized it wasn't just about the theoretical knowledge.
  It was about putting the ideas into motion. Now I'm a Project Manager at i3.
  I've been part of many initiatives such as Da'wah and Community Outreach. ALL
  students are encouraged to participate or lead such projects! 

  Joining the i3 program - I highly recommend it. It's a life-changing experience."
