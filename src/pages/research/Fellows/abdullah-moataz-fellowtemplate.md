description: Abdullah Moataz is a hadith researcher with several ijazah.
body: >-
  Abdullah Moataz is a hadith researcher originally hailing from Damascus, Syria
  though he was born and raised in the United States of America. His interest in
  hadith developed as a teenager through a “divinely decreed” accident. While
  flipping through a book, Moataz read a phrase that intrigued him. “The
  transmitters in this chain of transmission are reliable, yet it is nonetheless
  weak, as transmitter X never actually met transmitter Y.” Astonished at the
  detail required in hadith analysis, he began reading in the field to better
  educate himself and never stopped!


  To date he has written a short eBook entitled, “In Defense of Hadith Method,” as well as several short articles and essays, all of which have been published by Islamic Discourse Initiative: http://www.islamicdiscourseinitiative.com/author/abdullah-moataz/ and The Sunni Defense <http://www.twelvershia.net/?s=abdullah+moataz> . 


  udbThough Moataz has received dozens of Ijazat, he recognizes that the majority are meaningless; the only Ijazat which he views contain value are: An honorary Ijazah in Hadith from Dr. Hakem Al-Mutairi – Dr. Hakem awarded him this ijazah after Moataz sent him a bit of research for review. An Ijazah in the Bayquniyyah primer in hadith from Dr. Abu Zayd – this is the first Ijazah Moataz received and It was awarded after he recited the poem from memory to Dr. Abu Zayd and was then subject to a brief test on its meanings which he passed.
